# Student Portfolio

## Purpose of website
The purpose of this website is to create a basic portfolio. I added sections About me, Work, Contact me, and resume which doesn't exist yet 

## about me

this is a shoet story of me so you can understand a little of my past. I added styling to this so about me info will be below the image when youshrink the screen
